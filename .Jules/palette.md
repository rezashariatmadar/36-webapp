## 2024-05-22 - Mobile Glass Navigation
**Learning:** Glassmorphism on mobile requires a persistent bottom navigation bar instead of floating elements to ensure touch targets are always reachable and don't obscure content. High contrast backgrounds (bg-black/20) are essential for readability over complex backgrounds.
**Action:** Use sticky bottom-nav for primary actions on mobile; reserve glass headers for branding only.
