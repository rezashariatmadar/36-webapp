# UI/UX Audit Plan (Archived)

This document covered a pre-cutover template/islands cleanup workflow.
That flow is superseded by the React frontend migration in `frontend/`.

Use active references instead:
- `plan.md`
- `README.md`
- `frontend/src/*`

Any references here to `theme/templates`, `theme/static_src`, HTMX islands,
or generated legacy static bundles are considered historical context only.
